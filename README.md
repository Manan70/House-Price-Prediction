This project leverages machine learning to predict the prices of houses based on various features
such as longitude, latitude, number of rooms, bedrooms, population and more. Using historical data, 
the model aims to provide accurate price estimates, which can assist buyers, sellers and real estate
agents in making informed decisions.
